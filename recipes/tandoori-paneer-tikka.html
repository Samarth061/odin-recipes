        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Paneer tikka masala is a favorite dish both in North and South India although 
            the dish itself may have originated in North India. Traditionally, paneer is 
            roasted in a tandoor or a clay oven, but here you use your oven. The aroma of 
            spices and paneer cooking in the oven is mouthwatering and makes one feel 
            hungry right away. This recipe replicates the taste of paneer tikka masala served 
            in restaurants while eliminating cream and milk that is typically used. (Credit: All recipes)</p>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Soak 8 to 10 wooden skewers in water while you 
                prepare the kebabs.</li>
            <li>Process garlic and ginger in a food processor 
                until a smooth paste forms.</li> 
            <li>Combine yogurt, mustard oil, lime juice of 1/2 lime, 
                1 1/2 teaspoons fenugreek leaves, 1 teaspoon garam masala, 
                1/2 teaspoon cayenne, and 1/2 of the ginger-garlic paste in
                a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Add paneer, green bell pepper, 
                red bell pepper, and onion. Stir until coated.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Thread the coated paneer, peppers, and onion onto the soaked 
                skewers. Place kebabs in a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until kebabs are golden brown, 
                25 to 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Soak cashews in a bowl of hot water for 10 minutes; 
                blend as finely or coarsely as desired.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. 
                Add cumin seeds; cook until sputtering, about 1 minute. Add 
                remaining onion; cook and stir until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
                Add the remaining ginger-garlic paste, 1 tablespoon fenugreek leaves, 
                and 1/2 teaspoon garam masala. Cook and stir until flavors blend, 
                about 2 minutes. Stir in tomatoes; cover and cook until tomatoes break 
                down, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir the ground cashews into the saucepan with the tomato mixture. 
                Add juice of 1/2 lime, coriander, 1 teaspoon cayenne, turmeric, and salt. 
                Let simmer until sauce is thickened, adding some water if sauce gets 
                too dry and sticks to the pan, about 5 minutes more. Add the baked kebabs 
                to the sauce. Stir to coat evenly.</li>
